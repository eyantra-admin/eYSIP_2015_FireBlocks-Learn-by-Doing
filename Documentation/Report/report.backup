\chapter{Abstract}
In this report, a web application based Visual Programming Language is proposed for developing a language for easier
comprehension of Firebird V code.

\chapter{Objective of the Work}
The aim of this project is to develop a web application using Laravel Framework and design a Visual Programming Language for Firebird V. 
Blockly library is used for generating the blocks and parsing them to corresponding C code on the front-end.On the sever side PHP is used for parsing the XML to C code.
The final goal of this project is to deliver a web application that contains predefined blocks for writing the code for Firebird V. \\\\\\
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
	\hline\hline
	\bf Sr.No & \bf Tasks & \bf Deadline \\ 
	\hline
	1.) & Install Composer, Laravel, Blockly, PHP5 & 5 days \\
	\hline
	2.) & Define blocks same as one defined in Visual & 9 days \\
	& Programming Language &\\
	\hline
	3.) & Write Code for parsing the XML file  & 6 days \\
	& to C code on server side &\\
	\hline	
	4.) & Make Execute, Save and Open Button for both & 5 days \\
	& XML and C code &\\
	\hline
	5.) & Make compiler to convert C file to hex & 12 days\\
	& and provide it for download  &\\
	\hline
	6.) & Testing/Documentation (Usage Manual, Documented Code) & 8 days
	\\ \hline

\end{tabular} \\

\chapter{Completion}
All the tasks have been completed. The code written using the predefined blocks correctly forms the C syntax and the hex file is also 
made and can be downloaded on the user local machine.
\section{Task 1 - Install Composer, Laravel, Blockly, Xampp softwares}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Download Composer}\\
      Run this in your terminal to get the latest Composer version:\\
      \noindent
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
	 curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	\end{lstlisting}
      \item \textbf{Install Composer}\\
